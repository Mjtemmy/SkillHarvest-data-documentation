- ## Data cleaning and Preparation
   Exploratory data analysis involves exploring the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
  - What is the overall sales trend?
  - Which products are top sellers?
  - What are the products on peak sales?

  ## Data analysis
This is where some basic lines of codes or queries used during analysis
  ```
  SQL
  SELECT*
  FROM Table 1
  WHERE A,B,C = Positive Integers
```

## Result/findings
This is where you put the insight gotten from the analysis.
1. The company's sales have been progressively rising from the period of a specific time.
2. It has a set back at another point due to a particular trend that was observed along the line of analysis.
3. Customers segment with high lifetime value can be targeted for marketing efforts.
